    "congratulations": "Excellent work completing Priority 2 (Project Bootstrap Package)! Foundation components now complete: Process Memory (Priority 1), Skills Export (Priority 1.5), PROJECT-IMPERATIVES.md (Priority 1.9), and Bootstrap Package (Priority 2). Time to validate the system works holistically.",

    "task": "Create example thinking tools and validate end-to-end system functionality before core component implementation",

    "strategic_importance": {
      "why_now": "Imperative 1: Holistic System Thinking - Before building more components, verify foundation actually works end-to-end. Example tools validate YAML specs, template rendering, MCP server, Skills export, bootstrap workflow.",
      "current_state": "Infrastructure complete but only 1-2 example tools exist. Cannot validate dual-pattern architecture (MCP + Skills) without real thinking tools.",
      "problem": "Foundation may have integration issues hidden by lack of real tools. Bootstrap generates projects but no validation that tools actually execute correctly.",
      "impact": "Confidence that foundation works before investing effort in core components. Real tools enable dogfooding - using the framework to develop the framework."
