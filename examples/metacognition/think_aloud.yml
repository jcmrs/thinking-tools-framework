    ## Instructions

    Verbalize your reasoning process step-by-step. Don't edit or filter your thoughts - express them as they occur. This helps surface implicit assumptions, identify logic gaps, and make your reasoning transparent.

    ## Quick Think Aloud (5 minutes)

    1. **Current Understanding**: What do I currently understand about this situation?
       - Key facts I'm relying on:
       - What I'm certain about:
       - What I'm uncertain about:

    2. **Reasoning Path**: How am I approaching this?
       - First, I'm thinking...
       - Then, I need to...
       - Because...

    3. **Conclusion**: Where does this lead?
       - Therefore, I believe...
       - My confidence level: [high/medium/low]
       - Key assumption I'm making:

    {% elif depth == 'detailed' %}
    ## Detailed Think Aloud (15-20 minutes)

    ### 1. State Current Understanding
    What do I currently know or believe about this situation?

    - **Explicit knowledge**: Facts I've been told or observed directly
    - **Inferred knowledge**: Conclusions I've drawn from available information
    - **Assumptions**: Things I'm taking for granted (mark each as validated/unvalidated)
    - **Unknowns**: Critical information I'm missing
    - **Uncertainties**: Areas where I lack confidence

    ### 2. Articulate Mental Model
    What framework am I using to think about this?

    - **Primary lens**: How am I conceptualizing this problem? (e.g., as a technical challenge, a communication issue, a process problem)
    - **Analogies**: What does this remind me of? How is it similar/different?
    - **Constraints I'm aware of**: What boundaries am I operating within?
    - **Success criteria**: What would a good outcome look like?

    ### 3. Walk Through Reasoning Steps
    How am I getting from current state to conclusion?

    - **Step 1**: I start by...
      - Why this starting point?
      - What alternatives did I consider?

    - **Step 2**: Then I...
      - What led me from step 1 to step 2?
      - What am I assuming here?

    - **Step 3**: Next I...
      - How does this build on previous steps?
      - What could go wrong here?

    - **[Continue for all steps]**

    ### 4. Identify Decision Points
    Where did I make choices that could have gone differently?

    - **Decision 1**: When I chose to [action], I could have instead [alternative]
      - Why did I choose this path?
      - What trade-offs am I accepting?

    - **Decision 2**: [Continue for each major decision]

    ### 5. Question Assumptions
    What am I taking for granted that might not be true?

    For each assumption identified above:
    - **Assumption**: [State it clearly]
    - **Validity**: How confident am I this is true? [0-100%]
    - **Impact if wrong**: What happens if this assumption is incorrect?
    - **Can validate**: Yes/No - If yes, how?

    ### 6. Examine Biases
    What might be influencing my thinking unconsciously?

    - **Recency bias**: Am I over-weighting recent information?
    - **Confirmation bias**: Am I seeking data that confirms my hypothesis?
    - **Anchoring**: Did my initial impression overly influence me?
    - **Availability bias**: Am I relying on easily recalled examples?
    - **Expertise bias**: Am I assuming my domain knowledge applies here?

    ### 7. Explore Alternatives
    What other ways could I think about this?

    - **Alternative perspective 1**: If I approached this as [different lens], I would...
    - **Alternative perspective 2**: If I assumed [opposite assumption], then...
    - **Devil's advocate**: What would someone arguing against my conclusion say?

    ### 8. State Conclusion with Confidence

    - **Conclusion**: Based on this reasoning, I believe...
    - **Confidence level**: [high/medium/low] because...
    - **Key dependencies**: This conclusion rests on...
    - **Would change my mind if**: [What evidence would lead me to different conclusion]

    ### 9. Identify Open Loops
    What's left unresolved?

    - **Questions to investigate**:
    - **Assumptions to validate**:
    - **Alternative explanations to explore**:
    - **Information I need**:

    ### 1. State Current Understanding
    What do I currently understand about this situation?

    - Facts I'm relying on:
    - What I'm certain about:
    - What I'm uncertain about:
    - Critical unknowns:

    ### 2. Articulate Assumptions
    What am I taking for granted?

    - Assumption 1:
    - Assumption 2:
    - Assumption 3:
    - [Mark each as: validated ✓ / unvalidated ? / critical ! ]

    ### 3. Walk Through Reasoning
    How am I getting from A to B?

    - Starting point: I begin with...
    - Step 1: First, I...
    - Step 2: Then, I...
    - Step 3: Next, I...
    - Conclusion: Therefore, I...

    ### 4. Identify Decision Points
    Where did I make choices?

    - When I chose to [X], I could have instead [Y]
      - Why I chose X:
      - Trade-offs:

    ### 5. Question My Reasoning
    What might I be getting wrong?

    - Weakest point in my logic:
    - Assumption most likely to be false:
    - Alternative explanation:
    - What would make me change my mind:

    ### 6. State Conclusion

    - **I believe**: [conclusion]
    - **Confidence**: [high/medium/low]
    - **Because**: [key reason]
    - **Key dependency**: This relies on [critical assumption]

    ## Meta-Reflection

    After completing the think aloud:
    - Did verbalizing reveal any surprises?
    - Did I discover assumptions I wasn't aware of?
    - Did my confidence level change during the exercise?
    - What's the most important insight from this process?
