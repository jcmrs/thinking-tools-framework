    ## Instructions

    Assumptions are beliefs we take for granted without explicit verification. They're often invisible until challenged. This exercise systematically surfaces and validates assumptions that might be influencing your thinking.

    ## Assumption Validation Matrix

    For your top 5 most critical assumptions (from any category above):

    | # | Assumption | If True → Impact | If False → Impact | Validation Method | Urgency |
    |---|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
    | 1 |  | ✅ | ❌ |  | High/Med/Low |
    | 2 |  | ✅ | ❌ |  | High/Med/Low |
    | 3 |  | ✅ | ❌ |  | High/Med/Low |
    | 4 |  | ✅ | ❌ |  | High/Med/Low |
    | 5 |  | ✅ | ❌ |  | High/Med/Low |

    **Validation Methods:** User research, prototype test, data analysis, expert consultation, literature review, small experiment, etc.

    3. [Assumption]: If this is wrong, then...

    **Mitigation Plan:**
    - Validate these assumptions ASAP through...
    - Have backup plan if assumption proves false:
    - Decision point: Will re-evaluate if...

    ### Medium-Risk Assumptions (False = Moderate Impact)
    List assumptions where being wrong would require rework but not fundamental changes:

    1. [Assumption]: If this is wrong, then...
    2. [Assumption]: If this is wrong, then...

    ### Low-Risk Assumptions (False = Minor Impact)
    List assumptions where being wrong is easily correctable:

    1. [Assumption]: If this is wrong, then...
    2. [Assumption]: If this is wrong, then...
