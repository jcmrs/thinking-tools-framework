    ## Instructions

    Risk assessment helps identify potential problems, prioritize risks, and develop mitigation strategies.

    ## Risk Identification

    ### Technical Risks

    | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
    |------|-------------|--------|------------|
    | [Technical risk 1] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |
    | [Technical risk 2] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |

    ### Business Risks

    | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
    |------|-------------|--------|------------|
    | [Business risk 1] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |

    ### Operational Risks

    | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
    |------|-------------|--------|------------|
    | [Operational risk 1] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |

    ## Risk Priority Matrix

    **Critical Risks (High Impact + High Probability):**
    1. [Risk]: Immediate mitigation required

    **High Priority (High Impact):**
    1. [Risk]: Develop contingency plan

    **Monitor (High Probability, Lower Impact):**
    1. [Risk]: Track and mitigate if needed

    ## Mitigation Plans

    ### Top Risk: [Risk Name]

    **Prevention:**
    - Action: [What to do proactively]
    - Owner: [Who is responsible]
    - Timeline: [When to complete]

    **Detection:**
    - Metrics: [What to monitor]
    - Threshold: [Warning level]

    **Response:**
    - If occurs: [Immediate actions]
    - Escalation: [Who to notify]

    ## Contingency Plans

    **Scenario 1:** [Worst case]
    - Trigger: [What activates this plan]
    - Response: [Immediate actions]
    - Recovery: [How to recover]
